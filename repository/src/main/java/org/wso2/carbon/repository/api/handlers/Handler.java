/**
 * Base class of all handler implementations. Provides the methods that handlers should implement.
 * This class also provides the data source and repository instances to be
 * used by handler implementations.
 * <p/>
 * Handlers can be chained by providing necessary filter combinations. But in such cases, handler
 * authors should make sure that handlers in the chain do not perform conflicting operations. Unless
 * there is a critical requirement and handler authors are confident that handlers do not have
 * negative impact on each other, it is recommended that handlers are configured to execute only one
 * handler per request.
 * <p/>
 * Handler instances may be accessed concurrently by multiple threads. Therefore, handlers should be
 * thread safe. It is recommended that handlers are made state-less, instead of synchronizing them as
 * it could become a performance bottleneck in highly concurrent environments.
 * <p/>
 * Implementations of handlers should be optimized to take the minimum time for processing. As the
 * handlers are executed they are always executed before executing the generic database layer code, time
 * consuming operations in handlers could slow down the whole repository.
